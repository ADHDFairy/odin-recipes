    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Basic vanilla cake recipe</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>2 sticks unsalted butter at room temperature plus more for the pans</li>
      <li>3 cups all purpose flour, plus more for pans</li>
      <li>1 TBSP baking powder</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp salt</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups sugar</li>
      <li>4 large eggs, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1 TBSP vanilla extract</li>
      <li>1 1/4 cups whole milk</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter two 9-inch-round cake pans and line the bottoms with parchment paper; butter the parchment and dust the pans with flour, tapping out the excess.</li>
      <li>Whisk 3 cups flour, the baking powder and salt in a bowl until combined. Beat 2 sticks butter and the sugar in a large bowl with a mixer on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Reduce the mixer speed to medium; beat in the eggs, one at a time, scraping down the bowl as needed. Beat in the vanilla. (The mixture may look separated at this point.) Beat in the flour mixture in 3 batches, alternating with the milk, beginning and ending with flour, until just smooth.</li>
      <li>Divide the batter between the prepared pans. Bake until the cakes are lightly golden on top and a toothpick inserted into the middle comes out clean, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to racks and let cool 10 minutes, then run a knife around the edge of the pans and turn the cakes out onto the racks to cool completely. Remove the parchment. Trim the tops of the cakes with a long serrated knife to make them level, if desired.</li>
    </ol>
